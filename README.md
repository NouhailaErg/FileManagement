**File Management Project**

The project includes functionalities to create subdirectories for different file types such as images, videos, music, documents, code, and others.
Users can input the directory path interactively, and the script organizes files accordingly.

**How to Use:**
1- Run the script.
2- Input the directory path to organize files.
3- Files are automatically sorted into subdirectories based on their types.


Feel free to contribute, customize, or use this script for your file management needs!
